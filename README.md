## Abstract:
Road pavement detection is a critical task in maintaining road infrastructure, ensuring safety, and reducing maintenance costs. This study proposes a machine learning-based approach for detecting road pavement defects using high-resolution images. The proposed system utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and support vector machines (SVMs) to detect and classify pavement defects. The results show that the proposed approach achieves high accuracy and efficiency in detecting pavement defects, reducing manual effort and costs. The study demonstrates the potential of machine learning in improving road pavement detection, enabling proactive maintenance and enhancing road safety.

Keywords: Road Pavement Detection, Machine Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Image Processing, Road Safety.
